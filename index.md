# Silence My Car

## What is this
This is a site that contains guides that will teach you how to gain back your
privacy and freedom when it comes to your car.

## Why do we need this
Modern cars are a privacy nightmare. They collect loads of data and are equipped
with LTE modems that they use to send this data back to the manufacturer.
[Mozilla reviewed 25 car brands in terms of their privacy and all of them
failed.](https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/)
